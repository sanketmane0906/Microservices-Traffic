How Communication Happens in Traditional Applications:-

  In a traditional setup, when one service wants to communicate with another service, it needs to specify the IP address, hostname, or DNS name of the target service. 
  This approach does not include service discovery or dynamic load balancing, leading to potential challenges in managing service availability and scaling.

+------------------------+       Communication       +----------------------+
|  Account Microservice  | -----------------------> |  Loan Microservice   |
|  (Upstream Service)    |    via IP, DNS, Hostname |  (Downstream Service) |
+------------------------+                          +----------------------+
          
                              No Service Discovery
                              No Load Balancing
