Client-Side Service Discovery :-

   Applications need to register themselves into a service registry while starting.
   They also need to deregister when shutting down, either by adding or removing details.

                                                                        |

         | (Client asks   | ---------------------------------------------
         |  for Loan service) |   based on less load account service select one
         +----------------+

    In the previous diagram, we saw how the service registry stores the addresses of the loan services.
    When the Accounts service requests a loan service, it receives a list of available loan service instances and selects one for communication.

Developer Responsibilities in Client-Side Service Discovery:=

    The developer has to maintain the list of all available services.
    They need to handle service failures by updating or removing failed instances.
    Load balancing is handled inside the client, choosing the best instance dynamically.
    Developers should take care of communication failures and retry mechanisms.

In the last diagram, manual registration of services is not required.
                     Each service registers itself with the service registry.
                     Every service discovery node communicates with other nodes.
                     IP addresses are shared among all nodes, making service discovery efficient.
                     One important thing: We donâ€™t need to call services by their IP address.
                     Instead, we can call a service using its DNS name.
