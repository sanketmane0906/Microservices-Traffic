how a traditional load balancer works:-

                   +---------------------+
                   |     Client (User)   |
                   +---------------------+
                             |
                             | Request
                             v
                   +---------------------+
                   |   Load Balancer     |
                   +---------------------+
                      /       |       \
        -------------+        |        +-------------
       |                     |                      |
       v                     v                      v
+----------------+    +----------------+    +----------------+
|  Server 1      |    |  Server 2      |    |  Server 3      |
|  (Healthy)     |    |  (Healthy)     |    |  (Unhealthy)   |
+----------------+    +----------------+    +----------------+
        |                    |  
        | Response           | Response
        v                    v
+---------------------+  +---------------------+
|  Database 1        |  |  Database 2        |
+---------------------+  +---------------------+


Explanation:

  The client (user) sends a request.
  The load balancer receives the request and checks the health of backend servers.
  It distributes the request based on the load balancing algorithm (e.g., Round Robin, Least Connections).
  If a server is unhealthy, it is skipped.
  The selected server processes the request and may retrieve data from a database.
  The response is sent back to the client.

Limitations of Traditional Load Balancers :-

  Limited Scalability – Scaling requires adding more physical or virtual load balancers, which can be costly and complex.

  Single Point of Failure (SPOF) – If the load balancer itself fails, the entire system may become inaccessible unless a backup or failover mechanism is in place.

  Static Configuration – Traditional load balancers often require manual configuration, making it difficult to dynamically adjust to traffic spikes.
  
  Health Check Delays – Some traditional load balancers take time to detect and remove failed servers from the pool, affecting performance.

  Geographical Limitations – They may not efficiently handle traffic across multiple regions, leading to latency issues for global users.

  No Intelligent Traffic Routing – They usually distribute traffic based on simple algorithms (e.g., Round Robin, Least Connections) and don’t optimize for request types or server capabilities.

  Security Concerns – Traditional load balancers do not inherently provide security features like DDoS protection, WAF (Web Application Firewall), or bot mitigation.

  Lack of Application Awareness – They work at lower network layers (L4 or L7) and may not fully understand application-layer behavior, leading to inefficient routing.

  High Operational Costs – Physical load balancers require maintenance, and even virtual ones may have licensing costs.

  Not Ideal for Cloud-Native Applications – They struggle to efficiently manage microservices, containerized workloads, or dynamic cloud environments compared to modern cloud-based load balancers.
