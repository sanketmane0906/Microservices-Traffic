Spring Cloud Gateway :-
      We can use it to create an Edge Server for our microservices architecture.
      It handles any amount of workload by scaling horizontally.
      Consumes less memory compared to traditional API gateways.
      Built on a reactive framework (Spring WebFlux), making it non-blocking and highly efficient.

How It Works
    Acts as a gatekeeper for all incoming traffic, routing requests to appropriate microservices.
    Handles non-functional requirements like security, rate limiting, logging, and monitoring.
    Manages cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, authorization, and request transformations.
    It's not a separate server, but rather a library that we integrate into a Spring Boot application.
