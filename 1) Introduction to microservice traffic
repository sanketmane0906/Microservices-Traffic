Real-World Microservices Deployment Model :-

        In a real-world scenario, microservices are not deployed on different servers. Instead, they are deployed on the same server or cluster within a private network.

Client Interaction with Microservices :-

        Suppose there are three external clients (C1, C2, and C3) who want to access our microservices.
        Clients do not call microservices directly.
        Instead of Client 1 calling the Account microservice, 
                   Client 2 calling the Card microservice, and 
                   Client 3 calling the Loan microservice directly, 
                   they must go through a single entry point.

How Microservices are Accessed :- 

        All microservices are deployed within the same network.
        A firewall surrounds the microservices to protect them from direct external access.
        Any external client that wants to access a microservice must go through the API Gateway (Entry Point).

Role of the API Gateway :- 

        Handles security by restricting unauthorized access.
        Performs non-functional operations like logging, rate-limiting, and authentication.
        Routes client requests to the correct microservice.
