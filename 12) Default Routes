When you create gateway server with 

cloud: 
  gateway: 
    discovery: 
      locator: 
        enables: true 

Then it will give you the default routes by using service Id

if you want to check set this property to true and go to the  

localhost:8072/actuator/gateway/routes  it gives default routes from eurekaserver

and if you see the routes all service names are in uppervase letters if you want to set it to lowercase use following prperty

cloud: 
  gateway: 
    discovery: 
      locator: 
        lowerCaseServiceId: true 

now you can use in lowercase
