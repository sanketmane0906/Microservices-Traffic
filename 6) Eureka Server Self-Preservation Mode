Sometimes, the Eureka server goes into self-preservation mode. Every service sends a heartbeat to the Eureka server at regular intervals. 
If a service stops sending heartbeats, the Eureka server assumes that the service has crashed or become unresponsive. However, this might also happen due to network issues.
This behavior helps the Eureka server maintain an up-to-date registry. When it does not receive a heartbeat, the Eureka server unregisters the service from the registry.

    When such a situation occurs, the Eureka server enters self-preservation mode. When this mode is active, the Eureka server does not make changes to the service registry immediately, preventing unnecessary removals due to temporary network issues.
