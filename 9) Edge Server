Edge Server :-

It is also called as a API Gateway which mean it is single point from where all external commumnication can happen.

üî• What Can an Edge Server Do?

    1Ô∏è‚É£ Routing & Load Balancing
      Directs incoming requests to the correct microservice.
      Works with Eureka Server for dynamic service discovery.
      Supports client-side load balancing (e.g., lb://SERVICE-NAME).
    2Ô∏è‚É£ Security & Authentication
      Enforces OAuth2, JWT, or API key-based authentication.
      Can act as an Identity Provider for single sign-on (SSO).
      Blocks unauthorized requests before they reach microservices.
    3Ô∏è‚É£ Rate Limiting & Throttling
      Prevents DDoS attacks and abuse by limiting requests per second.
      Example: Allowing only 100 requests per minute per user.
    4Ô∏è‚É£ Resilience & Fault Tolerance
      Uses Circuit Breakers (Resilience4j/Hystrix) to prevent cascading failures.
      Implements retries and fallback mechanisms for failed requests.
    5Ô∏è‚É£ Request/Response Transformation
      Modifies headers, parameters, or payloads before passing requests.
      Converts XML to JSON or vice versa if needed.
    6Ô∏è‚É£ Logging & Monitoring
      Tracks all requests passing through the gateway.
      Works with Zipkin, Sleuth, ELK Stack for tracing.
    7Ô∏è‚É£ CORS & API Versioning
      Handles CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) for frontend apps.
      Supports API versioning (/api/v1/orders, /api/v2/orders).
