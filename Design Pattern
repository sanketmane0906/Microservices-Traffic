Gateway Offloading Pattern :-

    If your edge server is capable of handling cross-cutting concerns like security, monitoring, and rate limiting, then it follows the Gateway Offloading Pattern.
    The backend services remain focused on business logic while the gateway takes care of these common concerns.

Backend for Frontend (BFF) Pattern :-
    In this pattern, multiple edge servers are used, each dedicated to a specific client type.
    The Web application will have its own edge server.
    The Mobile application (Android/iOS) will have its own separate edge server.
    Each edge server customizes API responses as per the needs of the respective client, improving performance and reducing unnecessary data transfer.

Composition Pattern :-
    Sometimes, a client requires data from multiple backend services. 
    Instead of making separate API calls and aggregating data on the client side, the edge server (API gateway) retrieves data from multiple backend services, combines the responses, and sends a single response to the client. 
    This reduces the number of client requests and improves efficiency.
